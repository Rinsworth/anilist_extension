# Anilist Extension

This is an extension for [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) that is meant for random things that would make things more convenient for me. It's not really meant to be used by anyone else, but if you want to use it, go ahead.

## Features

The only feature right now is adding a hotkey to save and close a popup window for editing an entry in your list. That's basically it for now. I'll add more features as I think of them.
