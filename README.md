# Anilist Extension

This is an extension for [Anilist](https://anilist.co/) that is meant for random things that would make things more convenient for me. It's not really meant to be used by anyone else, but if you want to use it, go ahead.

## How to use

On Firefox, you go to [about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox) and click "Load Temporary Add-on". Then you select the manifest.json file in the extension folder.

On Chrome, you go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and click "Load Unpacked". Then you select the extension folder. I haven't tested it on Chrome, so it might not work.

## Features

The only feature right now is adding a hotkey (Enter) to save and close a popup window for editing an entry in your list. That's basically it for now. I'll add more features as I think of them.

## Future Features

When a popup window is open, it only shows your inputted information. I want to see some other relevant information that I use for my notes (average score, start/end date, etc). I'll probably add this in the future.


I should probably rewrite this in typescript. I'll do that when I have time.
